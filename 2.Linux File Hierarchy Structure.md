The Linux File Hierarchy Structure or the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) defines the directory structure and directory contents in Unix-like operating systems. It is maintained by the Linux Foundation.

- In the FHS, all files and directories appear under the root directory /, even if they are stored on different physical or virtual devices.
- Some of these directories only exist on a particular system if certain subsystems, such as the X Window System, are installed.
- Most of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.

**1\. / (Root):** Primary hierarchy root and root directory of the entire file system hierarchy.

- Every single file and directory starts from the root directory
- The only root user has the right to write under this directory
- /root is the root user's home directory, which is not the same as /

**2\. /bin :** Essential command binaries that need to be available in single-user mode; for all users, e.g., cat, ls, cp.

- Contains binary executables
- Common linux commands you need to use in single-user modes are located under this directory.
- Commands used by all the users of the system are located here e.g. ps, ls, ping, grep, cp

![bin-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/bin.png)

**3\. /boot :** Boot loader files, e.g., kernels, initrd.

- Kernel initrd, vmlinux, grub files are located under /boot
- Example: initrd.img-2.6.32-24-generic, vmlinuz-2.6.32-24-generic

![boot-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/boot-1.png)

**4\. /dev :** Essential device files, e.g., /dev/null.

- These include terminal devices, usb, or any device attached to the system.
- Example: /dev/tty1, /dev/usbmon0

![dev-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/dev.png)

**5\. /etc :** Host-specific system-wide configuration files.

- Contains configuration files required by all programs.
- This also contains startup and shutdown shell scripts used to start/stop individual programs.
- Example: /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/logrotate.conf.

![etc-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/etc.png)

**6\. /home :** Users' home directories, containing saved files, personal settings, etc.

- Home directories for all users to store their personal files.
- example: /home/kishlay, /home/kv

![home-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/home1.png)![home-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/home.png)

**7\. /lib :** Libraries essential for the binaries in /bin/ and /sbin/.

- Library filenames are either ld* or lib*.so.\*
- Example: ld-2.11.1.so, libncurses.so.5.7

![lib-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/lib.png)

**8\. /media :** Mount points for removable media such as CD-ROMs (appeared in FHS-2.3).

- Temporary mount directory for removable devices.
- Examples, /media/cdrom for CD-ROM; /media/floppy for floppy drives; /media/cdrecorder for CD writer

![media-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/media.png)

**9\. /mnt :** Temporarily mounted filesystems.

- Temporary mount directory where sysadmins can mount filesystems.

![mnt-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/mnt.png)

**10\. /opt :** Optional application software packages.

- Contains add-on applications from individual vendors.
- Add-on applications should be installed under either /opt/ or /opt/ sub-directory.

![opt-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/opt-1.png)

**11\. /sbin :** Essential system binaries, e.g., fsck, init, route.

- Just like /bin, /sbin also contains binary executables.
- The linux commands located under this directory are used typically by system administrator, for system maintenance purpose.
- Example: iptables, reboot, fdisk, ifconfig, swapon

![sbin-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/sbin.png)

**12\. /srv :** Site-specific data served by this system, such as data and scripts for web servers, data offered by FTP servers, and repositories for version control systems.

- srv stands for service.
- Contains server specific services related data.
- Example, /srv/cvs contains CVS related data.

![srv-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/srv.png)

**13\. /tmp :** Temporary files. Often not preserved between system reboots, and may be severely size restricted.

- Directory that contains temporary files created by system and users.
- Files under this directory are deleted when system is rebooted.

![tmp-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/tmp.png)

**14\. /usr :** Secondary hierarchy for read-only user data; contains the majority of (multi-)user utilities and applications.

- Contains binaries, libraries, documentation, and source-code for second level programs.
- /usr/bin contains binary files for user programs. If you can't find a user binary under /bin, look under /usr/bin. For example: at, awk, cc, less, scp
- /usr/sbin contains binary files for system administrators. If you can't find a system binary under /sbin, look under /usr/sbin. For example: atd, cron, sshd, useradd, userdel
- /usr/lib contains libraries for /usr/bin and /usr/sbin
- /usr/local contains users programs that you install from source. For example, when you install apache from source, it goes under /usr/local/apache2
- /usr/src holds the Linux kernel sources, header-files and documentation.

![usr_lib-linux-dirctory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/usr_lib-1.png)

![usr_local-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/usr_local.png)

![usr_src-linux-directory](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/usr_src-1.png)

**15\. /proc :** Virtual filesystem providing process and kernel information as files. In Linux, corresponds to a procfs mount. Generally automatically generated and populated by the system, on the fly.

- Contains information about system process.
- This is a pseudo filesystem contains information about running process. For example: /proc/{pid} directory contains information about the process with that particular pid.
- This is a virtual filesystem with text information about system resources. For example: /proc/uptime

Modern Linux distributions include a /run directory as a temporary filesystem (tmpfs) which stores volatile runtime data, following the FHS version 3.0. According to the FHS version 2.3, such data were stored in /var/run but this was a problem in some cases because this directory is not always available at early boot. As a result, these programs have had to resort to trickery, such as using /dev/.udev, /dev/.mdadm, /dev/.systems or /dev/.mount directories, even though the device directory isn't intended for such data.Among other advantages, this makes the system easier to use normally with the root filesystem mounted read-only. For example, below are the changes Debian made in its 2013 Wheezy release:

- /dev/._ ? /run/_
- /dev/shm ? /run/shm
- /dev/shm/_ ? /run/_
- /etc/_ (writable files) ? /run/_
- /lib/init/rw ? /run
- /var/lock ? /run/lock
- /var/run ? /run
- /tmp ? /run/tmp
