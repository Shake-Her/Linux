### File and Directory Compression Commands

The files can be compressed and then extracted to save the storage. We see this happening many times in our daily lives that we have to compress some file to send it or we have to extract a downloaded file. There are several commands for file compression in Linux given below:

| COMMAND                   | MEANING                                                                   | EXAMPLE & SYNTAX                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `gzip fileName`           | This command is used to compress a file with gzip compression.            | Example: The command to zip file1 using gzip compression is shown on the right.Syntax: `$ gzip file1`                                             |
| `gunzip fileName.gz`      | This command is used to unzip a file that has gzip compression.           | Example: The command to unzip fileDemo.gz file with gz compression is shown on the right.Syntax: `$ gunzip fileDemo.gz`                           |
| `tar cf myDir.tar myDir`  | This command is used to create an uncompressed tar archive.               | Example: The command to create an uncompressed tar archive for the directory demoDir is shown on the right.Syntax: `$ tar cf demoDir.tar demoDir` |
| `tar cfz myDir.tar myDir` | This command is used to create a tar archive with gzip compression.       | Example: The command to create gzip tar archive for the directory demoDir is shown on the right.Syntax: `$ tar cfz demoDir.tar demoDir`           |
| `tar xf file`             | This command is used to extract the contents of any type of tar archive.  | Example: The command to extract the content of demoFile tar archive is shown on the right.Syntax: `$ tar xf demoFile`                             |
