# I/O Redirection :-

- The work of any command is either taking input or gives an output or both. So, Linux has some command or special character to redirect these input and output functionalities. For example: suppose we want to run a command called “date” if we run it will print the output to the current terminal screen. But our requirement is different, we don’t want the output to be displayed on the terminal. We want the output to be saved in a file. This could be done very easily with output redirection. Redirection here simply means diverting the output or input.

**Types of Redirection**

**1\. Overwrite**

- ">" standard output
- "<" standard input

**2\. Appends**

- ">>" standard output
- "<<" standard input

**3\. Merge**

- "p >& q" Merges output from stream p with stream q
- "p <& q" Merges input from stream p with stream q

## Output Redirection

`The '>' symbol is used for output (STDOUT) redirection.`

Example:

```
ls -al > listings
```

- Here the output of command ls -al is re-directed to file "listings" instead of your screen.

- Note: Use the correct file name while redirecting command output to a file. If there is an existing file with the same name, the redirected command will delete the contents of that file and then it may be overwritten."

`use '>>' to append`: \***\*If you do not want a file to be overwritten but want to add more content to an existing file, then you should use '>>' operator.\*\***

You can redirect standard output, to not just files, but also devices!

`$ cat music.mp3 > /dev/audio`

The cat command reads the file music.mp3 and sends the output to /dev/audio which is the audio device. If the sound configurations in your PC are correct, this command will play the file music.mp3

## Input redirection

`The '<' symbol is used for input(STDIN) redirection`

- Example: The mail program in Linux can help you send emails from the Terminal.

- You can type the contents of the email using the standard device keyboard. But if you want to attach a File to email you can use the input re-direction operator in the following format.

Mail -s "Subject" to-address < Filename

![Redirection in Linux/Unix - Demystified!](https://www.guru99.com/images/Email.png "Redirection in Linux/Unix - Demystified!")

- This would attach the file with the email, and it would be sent to the recipient.

The above examples were simple. Let's look at some advance re-direction techniques which make use of File Descriptors.

## Error Redirection

- Whenever you execute a program/command at the terminal, 3 files are always open, viz., standard input, standard output, standard error.

![Redirection in Linux/Unix - Demystified!](https://www.guru99.com/images/Streams.png "Redirection in Linux/Unix - Demystified!")

These files are always present whenever a program is run. As explained before a file descriptor, is associated with each of these files.

File - File Descriptor

Standard Input STDIN - 0

Standard Output STDOUT - 1

Standard Error STDERR - 2

By default, error stream is displayed on the screen. Error redirection is routing the errors to a file other than the screen.

## Why Error Redirection?

Error re-direction is one of the very popular features of Unix/Linux.

Frequent UNIX users will reckon that many commands give you massive amounts of errors.

- For instance, while searching for files, one typically gets permission denied errors. These errors usually do not help the person searching for a particular file.
- While executing shell scripts, you often do NOT want error messages cluttering up the normal program output.

The solution is to re-direct the error messages to a file.

Example 1

$ myprogram 2>errorsfile

![Redirection in Linux/Unix - Demystified!](https://www.guru99.com/images/myprogram.jpg "Redirection in Linux/Unix - Demystified!")

Above we are executing a program names myprogram.

The file descriptor for standard error is 2.

Using "2>" we re-direct the error output to a file named "errorfile"

Thus, program output is not cluttered with errors.
