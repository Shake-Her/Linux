# touch:-

- Introduction
  - The `touch` command's primary function is to modify a timestamp. Commonly, the utility is used for file creation, although this is not its primary function. The terminal program can change the modification and access time for any given file. The `touch` command only if the file doesn't already exist.

## touch Command Syntax

The fundamental syntax for the `touch` command is:

```
touch <options> <file or directory name>
```

The touch utility works without any options or with multiple options for advanced queries. Some options have a long and short format. If an option requires additional information, then the data is mandatory for both long and short forms.
