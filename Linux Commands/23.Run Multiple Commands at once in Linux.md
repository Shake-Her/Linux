# How to Run Multiple Commands at once in Linux

- As a Linux administrator, you may know how useful the command line can be to work with various activity such as installing the application, installing the system patch, and restarting the service.Running two or more commands at once is even more efficient and saves good time.

| Operator        | Syntax                      | Description                                           |
| --------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Semicolon `(;)` | command 1; command2         | Execute command 1 first and then command 2            |
| AND `(&&)`      | command 1 && command2       | Execute command 2 only if command 1 runs successfully |
| OR (orsign)     | command 1 (orsign) command2 | Execute command 2 only if command 1 fails             |

---

1. Concatenate commands with the Semicolon operator (;)

---

If you want to execute all commands regardless of whether the previous ones failed or not, separate them with semicolons. This executes all commands one after another.

Common Syntax:

```
command 1; command 2; ... command N
```

---

2. Run two or more commands at once in Linux using the Logical AND operator (&&)

---

If you want to execute each command only when it’s previous command runs successfully, then combine them using the ‘&&’ operator.

Common Syntax:

```
command 1 && command 2 && … command N
```

---

3. Execute multiple Linux commands simultaneously with the Logical OR operator (||)

---

If you want to run the next command only if the previous command failed, concatenate them to the '||' operator.

The 'OR' operator will only execute 'command 2' if 'command 1' fails or returns an error. Similarly, if 'command 1' runs successfully, 'command 2' won't execute.

Common Syntax:

```
command 1 || command 2 || ... command N
```
