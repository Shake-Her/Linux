*kill* command in Linux (located in /bin/kill), is a built-in command which is used to terminate processes manually. *kill* command sends a signal to a process which terminates the process. If the user doesn't specify any signal which is to be sent along with kill command then default *TERM *signal is sent that terminates the process.

#### Options and examples

**1\. kill -l :**To display all the available signals you can use below command option:

**Syntax:**

```
$kill -l
```

_Signals can be specified in three ways:_

- **By number (e.g. -5)**
- **With SIG prefix (e.g. -SIGkill)**
- **Without SIG prefix (e.g. -kill)**

**Note:**

- Negative PID values are used to indicate the process group ID. If you pass a process group ID then all the process within that group will receive the signal.
- A PID of -1 is very special as it indicates all the processes except kill and init, which is the parent process of all processes on the system.
- To display a list of running processes use the command *ps* and this will show you running processes with their PID number. To specify which process should receive the kill signal we need to provide the PID.

  **Syntax:**

```
$ps
```

**3\. kill -s :** To show how to send signal to processes.

**Syntax:**

```
kill {-signal | -s signal} pid
```

**4\. kill -L :**This command is used to list available signals in a table format.

**Syntax:**

```
kill {-l | --list[=signal] | -L | --table}
```
