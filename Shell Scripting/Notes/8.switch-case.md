# CASE in shell scripting!

- The basic syntax of the case...esac statement is to give an expression to evaluate and to execute several different statements based on the value of the expression.
  The interpreter checks each case against the value of the expression until a match is found. If nothing matches, a default condition will be used.

SYNTAX

```bash
case word in
   pattern1)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern1 matches
      ;;
   pattern2)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern2 matches
      ;;
   pattern3)
      Statement(s) to be executed if pattern3 matches
      ;;
   *)
     Default condition to be executed
     ;;
esac
```

Eg:

```bash
fruit="kiwi"

case "$fruit" in
   "apple") echo "Apple pie is quite tasty."
   ;;
   "banana") echo "I like banana nut bread."
   ;;
   "kiwi") echo "New Zealand is famous for kiwi."
   ;;
esac
```

APPLICATION:

```bash
#A good use for a case statement is the evaluation of command line arguments as follows −

#!/bin/sh

option="${1}"
case ${option} in
   -f) FILE="${2}"
      echo "File name is $FILE"
      ;;
   -d) DIR="${2}"
      echo "Dir name is $DIR"
      ;;
   *)
      echo "`basename ${0}`:usage: [-f file] | [-d directory]"
      exit 1 # Command to come out of the program with status 1
      ;;
esac
```

## Some patterns to remember!!! For patterns part!

- [a-z] ) specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from “a” to “z”
- [A-Z] ) specifies a range which matches any lowercase letter from “A” to “Z”
- [0-9] ) specifies a range which matches any value 0 to 9″ ;;
- ? ) Matches a string with exactly one character like a, !, and so on.

- "\*" ) Matches a string with one or more characters (a nonempty string).
