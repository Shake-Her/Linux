# ARITHMETIC OPERATION

The backtick ' `` ' is actually called command substitution. The purpose of command substitution is to evaluate the command which is placed inside the backtick and provide its result as an argument to the actual command.

- Method One

Eg:

```bash
val=`expr $a + $b`
echo "a + b : $val"
```

- Method Two:

Using **_(())_**

Eg :

```bash
echo $((2+4))
echo $((x-y))
```

- Method three

Eg:

```bash
# Same as method one but direct
Echo $(expr $x+$y) #note : You should use \ on the * symbol for multiplication.
```

## FLOATING POINT NUMBERS OPERATIONs

- In Bash shell, we can only perform integer arithmetic. If we want to perform arithmetic involving a floating point or fractional values, then we will need to use various other utilities, such as awk, bc, and similar.
  Eg:

```bash
echo “20.5 + 5 “ | bc
```

- Steps

1. “20.5 + 5” or “$x + $y” is the expression here

2. ‘|’ Pipe symbol: means everything on the left hand side will be treated as right hand sides input!
   3] bc : bc command is used for command line calculator. It is similar to basic calculator by using which we can do basic mathematical calculations.

> So here because of the pipe ‘|’ everything on the left is input for bc

**Note: for division bc command will given value in integer rather than a decimal value that’s why we use scale to place the decima pointer after how many places**

**Eg: echo correct way to use division in bc cmd**

```bash
echo "scale=4;$x / $y" | bc
```

## Exponent and Square root

- To use expo and square from bc command we leed maths lib that's why we use ‘-l’ flag
  ‘-l’ stores the squareroot and power function

```bash
num=3
echo "scale=3;sqrt($num)" | bc -l #-l is a math lib stores the function for sqrt
echo "scale=3;2.9^$num" | bc -l
```
