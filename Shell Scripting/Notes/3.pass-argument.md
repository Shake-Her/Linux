# PASS ARGUMENTS

- A command line argument is a parameter that we can supply to our Bash script at execution. They allow a user to dynamically affect the actions your script will perform or the output it will generate.
  In our Bash script, there are several reserved/pre-defined variables which we can use to recall the user-defined parameters.

To pass an argument to your Bash script, your just need to write it after the name of your script:

terminal:-

```
./pass_arguments.sh my_argument1 my_argument2 my_argument3
```

- The first argument is stored in $1, the second in $2, the third in $3…and so on. We cannot use $0 as that references your Bash script itself.

- $@ :- It is used to print all the arguments at once or can be used to store teh arguments in an array Syntax

```bash
Print = `$@`
Array of arguments = `arguments = (“$@”)`
```

```bash
$#
To print the no. of arguments passed
```
