SHEBANG

## What is shebang in shell scripting?

Ans:-The shebang is the combination of the # (pound key) and ! (exclamation mark). This character combination has a special meaning when it is used in the very first line of the script. It is used to specify the interpreter with which the given script will be run by default.
So, if the first line of a script is:

Note:bash is superset or sh

```
#!/bin/bash  or #!/bin/sh
```

It means the interpreter should be bash shells
