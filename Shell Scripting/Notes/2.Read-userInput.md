# READ

- We use `read` command to read the user enteredData

Syntax:-

```bash
read varname
```

- READ Flags :

  -p : If we want to take input from the user on the same line then..

  -sp : If we want to take input from the user on the same line and not shown on the terminal
  Like a password then…

  -a : If we want to take input from the user on the same line and have multiple input store i in an array then….

- $REPLY:-

  - This is the default built in variable that stores the entered input by the user

  - EG: lets say we wrote`read (no variable here)`Then how can we get the value at the part if no variable stored the value the answer is $REPLY
