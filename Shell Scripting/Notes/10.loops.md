# Loops

## WHILE LOOP

SYNTAX

```bash
while command
do
   Statement(s) to be executed if command is true
done
```

Eg:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
a=0

while [ $a -lt 10 ]
do
   echo $a
   a=`expr $a + 1`
done
```

## SLEEP COMMAND

- This command executes the code after given amount of secs

```bash
while [ $x -lt 10 ]
do
	echo $x
	x=`expr $x + 1`
	sleep 2 #after 2 secs it means
done

```

## PRACTICE PROBLEMS

- Q1] Open given number of terminals
- Q2]Read a file using While loop
- Solved both in shellScript file 10!

## UNTIL loop

The difference between while and until is while loop executes if condition is true and in until if itâ€™s false

SYNTAX

```bash
until command
do
   Statement(s) to be executed until command is true
done
```

```bash
#until loop: It's runs only when the condition is false!

echo -e "enter a number : \c"
read y

until [ $y -gt 5 ]
do
	echo false codition is running 5 is greater than $y
	y=`expr $y + 1`
done
```

## FOR LOOPS

SYNTAX

```bash
for VARIABLE in 1 2 3 4 5 .. N
do
    command1
    command2
    commandN
done

OR

for VARIABLE in file1 file2 file3
do
    command1 on $VARIABLE
    command2
    commandN
done

OR
for OUTPUT in $(Linux-Or-Unix-Command-Here)
do
    command1 on $OUTPUT
    command2 on $OUTPUT
    commandN
done

OR
#!/bin/bash
for i in {1..5}
do
   echo "Welcome $i times"
done

OR
for (( EXP1; EXP2; EXP3 ))
do
    command1
    command2
    command3
done
## The C-style Bash for loop ##
for (( initializer; condition; step ))
do
  shell_COMMANDS
done

```

## SELECT LOOP

SYNTAX

```bash
select var in word1 word2 ... wordN
do
   Statement(s) to be executed for every word.
done
```

## BREAK N CONTINUE

```bash
SYNTAX : break
SYNTAX: continue
```
