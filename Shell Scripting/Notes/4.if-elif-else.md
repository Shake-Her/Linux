# if,elif,else

The if...elif...fi statement is the one level advance form of control statement that allows Shell to make correct decision out of several conditions.

```bash
if [ expression 1 ]
then
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 1 is true
elif [ expression 2 ]
then
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 2 is true
elif [ expression 3 ]
then
   Statement(s) to be executed if expression 3 is true
else
   Statement(s) to be executed if no expression is true
fi
```

COMPARISON EXPRESSIONS

```An expression can be: String comparison, Numeric comparison, File operators and Logical operators and it is represented by [expression]:

#Numeric Comparision!

flags:-
-eq - is equal to - if [ "$a" -eq "$b" ]

-ne - is not equal to - if [ "$a" -ne "$b" ]

-gt - is greater than - if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]

-ge - is greater than or equal to - if [ "$a" -ge "$b" ]

-lt - is less than - if [ "$a" -lt "$b" ]

-le - is less than or equal to - if [ "$a" -le "$b" ]







Operators:-
< - is less than - (("$a" < "$b"))

<= - is less than or equal to - (("$a" <= "$b"))

> - is greater than - (("$a" > "$b"))

>= - is greater than or equal to - (("$a" >= "$b"))






#String Comparision
= - is equal to - if [ "$a" = "$b" ]

== - is equal to - if [ "$a" == "$b" ]

!= - is not equal to - if [ "$a" != "$b" ]

< - is less than, in ASCII alphabetical order - if [[ "$a" < "$b" ]]

> - is greater than, in ASCII alphabetical order - if [[ "$a" > "$b" ]]

-z - string is null, that is, has zero length
```
